## About Processing

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It is developed by artists and designers as a platform for experimentation and is designed for creating interactive programs that produce visual outputs. Processing is based on Java, allowing for powerful and complex interactive designs.

## How to Run

To run these sketches, you'll need to have the Processing IDE installed on your computer. You can download the Processing IDE from the [official Processing website](https://processing.org/download/). Once installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Processing IDE and select "Open..." from the File menu.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open any `.pde` file within the sketch folders.
4. Press the "Run" button in the IDE to compile and run the sketch.

Alternatively, you can explore and modify these sketches using the [Processing Development Environment (PDE)](https://processing.org/reference/environment/), which provides a straightforward way to work with Processing projects.
