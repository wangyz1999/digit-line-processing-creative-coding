# Dynamic Processing Animations 

Welcome to this repository! Here, you will find an assortment of animations made with the flexible and highly expressive creative coding tool, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). This is a great place to learn, understand, and draw inspiration from code that uses [Processing](https://processing.org/), a software sketchbook and language aimed at teaching code in a visual context.

This code is open source and encourages creative exploration. Feel free to use it as a springboard for your own imaginative projects!
